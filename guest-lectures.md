## Preparation

Speakers contribute valuable time to come do a talk, respect their time. Please come to the lecture prepared in advance. Research the speaker and make sure you jot down some notes and questions. To get the most out of a talk we strongly recommend [sketchnoting][sketch].

* Who is the speaker?
* What companies did the speaker work for?
* What are recent projects the speaker worked on?
* What is the speakers topic and specialty?
* Do you have any questions about a particular topic?
