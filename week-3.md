## Assignments

### Request (practice)

[![][request-cover]][request-cover-source]

> Outer Space by [**@nasa**][request-cover-author].

In this assignment you’ll fetch data from an `external rest api`.

#### Synopsis

*   **Homework**
*   **Time**: 2:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal 7, subgoal 8, subgoal 9,
    subgoal 10, and subgoal 12
*   **Due**: before [lab 4][w4lab]

#### Tips

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

Take ± 2 hours to make a request to an `external api` and render the data coming back.

**Research**

Take about 0:30h to investigate different ways to get data from an api.
*   What's the difference between client-side requests (using `XMLHttpRequest` or `Fetch`) and doing these server-side (using `http` or `request`)?
*   What types of API's are there?
*   Which `types of data` do you get?

**Build**
* Make a request to an external public API
  * [`public APIs`](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) is a collective list of free APIs you can use.
  * You can pick one which has no `auth` such as [`RandomCat`](https://aws.random.cat/meow) or [`MetaWeather`](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)
* Render the data coming back using your `template engine`
  * You will likely recieve [`JSON`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) you'll need to convert

**Optional:**
* You can pick an API with `auth` but then you need to work with API keys, can you get that working?
* Can you normalize or make a subset of the data?
  * These [`array.protoype`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype) higher order functions might come in handy. 

## Homework

### Data (feature)

[![][data-cover]][data-cover-source]

> Archive storage by [**@samuelzeller**][data-cover-author].

Work on receiving user input and manipulating data for your own Job Story.

#### Synopsis

*   **Homework**
*   **Time**: 6:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal 7, subgoal 8, subgoal 9,
    subgoal 10, and subgoal 12
*   **Due**: before [lab 4][w4lab]

#### Tips

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

Take ± 6 hours to build out a feature were you'll receive **user input** and manipulate the data. This is quite a vague assignment and the end result will be specific to your Job Story. Make sure you at least spend the alloted hours on this. 

Some examples to get you started, think about the movie example from the lecture:

*   You can make users upload a profile picture
*   Add new users to an overview list of people
*   Make users enter their hobbies and interests
*   Etc.

Try to break down in small functionalities and think about what steps you need to complete.
* How do you render (send) data inside of your template?
* Do you need to create a form as a `partial` with the corresonpding `attributes`?
* What type of request do you need to send? Is a `post` needed?
* Any packages from `npm` you can use? Maybe [`slug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slug), [`body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) or [`multer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)?
