## Oral Test - Team
You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product and finish with an oral test (_summative_) where you **present** your final project with your **team**. First you'll present the whole project as a team, then you'll show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project.

You will show you can create a quality project in which you apply the subject matter of this course and that you understand it. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

> **This is a team assessment but you'll be graded individually!** Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for back-end. For example; you can't just _work on the CSS of the project_ because that was your role. Working with CSS is not a learning goal of this course.

### Preperation
Presenting your work is a skill all by itself, make sure you and your team prepare yourself properly. The best way is to treat it as [public speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking) and there are [many books](https://be.noti.st/2018/recommended-books-for-public-speakers) on public speaking available.
* Bring your own computer and a charger.
* Have the latest version of your code ready in your editor.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a live version up and running.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the oral test is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the test. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

## Publishing
Grades will be published and communicated trough _Email_, _Moodle_ and/or _Slack_ based on student numbers.

* Final grades will be **published** _one week_ after test date.
* Final grades will be put in **SIS** _two weeks_ after test date.

> After the oral test you can request **viewing time** for additional feedback, this can be useful for a resit. Feel free to [contact your lecturer](/readme#synopsis) if you want to do so.

## Plagiarism

💁  We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee

Regulations (TER) 2017-2018 (in Dutch: Onderwijs- en examenregeling, OER) for
a full definition, but here are a few cases that count as plagiarism:

> a. using or copying someone else’s texts, data or ideas without a full and
> correct acknowledgement of sources;
> b. presenting the structure or central ideas developed by someone else as
> your own work or ideas, even when a reference to other authors has been
> included;
>
> \[…]
>
> e. copying (parts of) media files or other sources, software source codes,
> models and other diagrams of other people without acknowledgement and
