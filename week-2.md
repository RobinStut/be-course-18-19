In this assignment you’ll apply your HTTP knowledge in Node by building a static
file server with a little help from Express.

#### Synopsis

*   **Practice**
*   **Time**: 5:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal s7
*   **Due**: before [lab 3][w3lab]

#### Tips

*   [`plain-server`](examples/plain-server)
    (**example**)
*   [`express-server`](examples/express-server)
    (**example**)
*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

Take ± 5 hours to create a server that handles routes and serves static files in Node.js. Feel free to write your server from scratch if you feel adventurous, otherwise [`express`](https://expressjs.com/) is your best option. 

Your static server should:

*   Have a couple of different `routes` (e.g. `/about` `/login`)
*   Respond with `404 Not Found`
*   Serve `static files`
    * Images
    * JavaScript
    * CSS
    * Any other?
*   Use a `template engine` (`pug`, `ejs`, `handlebars`) to dynamically render data
    * Create different `partials` (includes) for components of your page
