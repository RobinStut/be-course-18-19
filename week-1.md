## Assignments

### learnyounode (practice)

[![][learnyounode-cover]][learnyounode-cover-source]

> Lose Yourself by [**@claybanks1989**][learnyounode-cover-author].

In this assignment you’ll learn the basics of Node.

#### Synopsis

*   **Practice**
*   **Time**: 3:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal 1, subgoal 2
*   **Due**: before [lab 3][w3lab]

#### Tips

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][bugs] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

Take ± 3 hours to follow the [learnyounode][] workshopper through to completion.

Workshoppers are interactive, self guided lesson modules, used as curriculum in
[NodeSchool][]: free and in-person hosted workshops.
At NodeSchool, mentors help attendees work through the challenges, but you can
also work through workshoppers on your own, or with friends or colleagues.

[NodeSchool Amsterdam][nsa] is pretty active: about once per month there’s a
workshop.
It’s also a lot of fun.
Need some extra help?
Want to meet more developers?
Definitely attend one of the workshops!

Other than `learnyounode`, workshoppers exist for JavaScript, npm, Express,
Electron, and much more.  Feel free to peruse the
[list of workshoppers][workshoppers] and try anything that sounds interesting.

## Homework

You’re expected to spend about 6 hours on assignments outside of class. Submit your assignments before [lab 3][w3lab].

### Package (Feature)

[![][package-cover]][package-cover-source]

> Parcel, package, candy cane and string by
> [**@kadh**][package-cover-author].

You’ll learn the basics of node modules and npm packages and setup a boilerplate for your own feature.

#### Synopsis

*   **Homework**
*   **Time**: 6:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal 1, subgoal 2
*   **Due**: before [lab 3][w3lab]

#### Tips

*   Stuck?  See the [Bugs][bugs] section of the course readme to find a list of
    troubleshooting tips

#### Description

1. Create the boilerplate for the feature you are going to create. Include a `package.json` with a correct name, version, dependencies, and other
metadata.
See npm’s documentation on [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).
For examples of `package.json` files, see
[`repeat-string`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/repeat-string/blob/master/package.json),
[`longest-streak`](https://github.com/wooorm/longest-streak/blob/master/package.json),
or [`skin-tone`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/skin-tone/blob/master/package.json).

2. Pick a package from [npm][npmjs] that would be helpful for your feature and use it in your `index.js`
    * Not sure what dependency to pick? You can try to get [`nodemon`](https://nodemon.io/) up and runnning or make an example using the [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/) package.
    * Can you create some [`scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) in your `package.json` to start your `index.js`?

3. Add a `readme.md` to your repo, documenting the code: how to install it, how to use
it (with examples), a license.
For examples  of `readme.md` files, see
[`concat-stream`](https://github.com/maxogden/concat-stream#readme),
[`ccount`](https://github.com/wooorm/ccount#readme),
or [`normalize-url`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/normalize-url#readme). Here's a good article on [the art of `READMEs`](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme).

4. Add a [license](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/) to your repository. What are the differences between each license?

If you have some time left and would like to dig further you can:

*   Add a [`.gitignore`](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)
*   Add a [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org)

…most of the previously linked to projects have the above in place, look at
them for examples.

Ask yourself upon completion:
* What's the difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`?
* What are the differences between `global` and `local` dependencies?
